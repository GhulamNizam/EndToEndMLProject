## Data
The dataset used for this project is [Vehicle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) . It includes information about used cars.

## Data Analysis
The initial phase involves understanding the dataset and identifying patterns that may influence car selling prices.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focuses on exploring relationships between features and gaining insights from the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the model's predictive performance.

## Visualization
Data visualization is employed to present insights gained from the dataset and facilitate better understanding.

## Model Building
The core of the project is building a machine learning regression model to predict car selling prices.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluation of the model using cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance.

## Prediction
The trained model is used to make predictions, and the results are showcased through a Flask web application.
